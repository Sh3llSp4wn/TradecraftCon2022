# Additional Notes

For other operating system compatibility with this project the syscall interface will need to be modified slightly. Given this test case is currently written to be compiled and run on x86\_64 Linux, the calling convention parameter is not used. For compatibility with other syscall interfaces on other POSIX operating systems the calling convention of the syscall definitions must be changed in the `f.h`
