# Waiter There's a Shellcode Compiler in my Linker

This presentation was given using the `mdp` presentation tool here: https://github.com/visit1985/mdp 

`mpd` uses standard markdown files so the `slides.md` file is also viewable via anything that can render markdown (such as github, which is likely where you are right now XD ).

Reading this in rendered markdown has a few indentation failures, but otherwise is perfectly readable.
